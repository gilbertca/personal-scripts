## zshrc
My personal zshrc, with some hardware dependent scripts redacted
## screenshot.sh
TODO
## init.vim
My personal `nvim` configuration
## aijsonify.py
A helper script used by ai.sh. You *probably* won't use this by itself, and it's *probably* not complete.
## status_bar.sh
The program called by `sway` from **swayconfig** to tell the time and battery.
## sources.list
The default Debian Synaptic **sources.list**, but with non-free and contrib repos added
## swayconfig
My personal `sway` config, with some hardware dependent configurations redacted
## foot.ini
My personal `foot` config; only includes the IBM-PLEX font configuration
## ai.sh
A script (which *probably* doesn't work very well right now) that allows the user to take a screenshot of an area, and pipe that image to an LLM. Depends on **aijsonify.py** to format the JSON.
## setup-debian.sh
My personal setup script for the Debian OS. You are expected to have downloaded `git` and already cloned the repo... where else would you get the file from?
